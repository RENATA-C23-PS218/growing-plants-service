RENATA (Rekomendasi Tumbuhan dan Tanah) is an application to provide recommendations for plants that are suitable for growing on certain soils. Our application works by scanning photo uploaded or taken by the user, then it will identify what soil is. After that, our application will show plant recommendations suitable for the soil.
